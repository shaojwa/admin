#### Rules
```
target ... : prerequisites ...
      recipe
      ...
      ...
```

#### Target
1. A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program. such as executable or object files.
2. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as clean.

#### Prerequisites
1. A prerequisite is a file that is used as input to create the target.
2. However the rule that specifies a recipe for the target need not have prerequisites.

**it looks that the prerequisite can be the name of another target.**

#### Recipe
A recipe is an action that make carries out. These recipes say how to update the target file.

#### NOTE
Please note: you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line!

#### When to remake the target
make carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target. 

#### Both in target and a prerequisite
Infact, each ‘.o’ file is both a target and a prerequisite.
In addition, any prerequisites that are themselves automatically generated should be updated first.

####  Make starts with
By default, make starts with the first target, This is called the default goal.

#### Goal
Goals are the targets that make strives ultimately to update.


The other rules are processed because their targets appear as prerequisites of the goal.
If some other rule is not depended on by the goal (or anything it depends on, etc.), that
rule is not processed, unless you tell make to do so.

#### Target not exist
After recompiling whichever object files need it, make decides whether to relink edit.
This must be done if the file edit does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer thanit.


#### 注意
Prerequisites 可以不是具体的文件名，可以只是一个label，如果这个lavel是一个target，那么这个target是跟新也就会依赖于这个target的Prerequisites，比如：
```
last:
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $(BINARY) $(last_source)

run: last
        cat data.in | ./$(BINARY)
```

#### 没有依赖项的target每次都会执行
run依赖last，因为last没有依赖的项目，所以last每次都会执行。

#### 有依赖项，但是这个target并不存在对应的文件，每次都会执行。
如果last依赖其他文件，那么会比较last和其他文件的时间，如果没有名为last的文件，那么这个target对应的recipe每次都要执行，就算有依赖的文件。
