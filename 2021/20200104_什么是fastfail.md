#### fast fail
In systems design, a fail-fast system is one which immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure.
Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early.
The responsibility of a fail-fast module is detecting errors, then letting the next-highest level of the system handle them.

#### it is a module
In object-oriented programming, a fail-fast-designed object initializes the internal state of the object in the constructor, launching an exception if something is wrong (vs allowing non-initialized or partially initialized objects that will fail later due to a wrong "setter").

In functions, fail-fast code will check input parameters in the precondition.

In client-server architectures, fail-fast will check the client request just upon arrival, before processing or redirecting it to other internal components, returning an error if the request fails (incorrect parameters, ...).

Fail-fast-designed code decreases the internal software entropy, and reduces debugging effort.
