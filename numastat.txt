// numastat show memory statistics only
// numastat is provided by the numactl package. 
numa <pid>
numastat -p <pid> // same as numa <pid>

// the memory allocated on this node as intended, maybe by the processes running on the other node
numa_hit
// the memory allocated on the node despite the process perfers diff node.
numa_miss


// allocated by the processes on the same node, not matter the perfer node of the process
local_node
// allocated by the processes on the other node, not matter the perfer node of the process
other_node

so  numa_hit, numa_miss, local_node, other_node is all allocate in the current node.
and numa_hit + numa_miss = local_node + other_node

a = local_process_intend_local_success
b = other_process_intend_local_success
c = local_process_intend_other_failure
d = other_process_intend_other_failure
numa_hit  = a + b
numa_miss = c + d
local_node = a + c
other_node = b + d
interleave = b + c

a =  (numa_hit +  local_node - interleave)/2
b =  (numa_hit + interleave - local_node)/2
c =  (local_node + interleave - numa_hit)/2
